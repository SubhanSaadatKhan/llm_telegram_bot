**LLM Telegram Bot**

This is a Telegram chatbot that uses the TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat model to generate intelligent and conversational responses. It’s built using the Python Telegram Bot library and Hugging Face’s Transformers pipeline.

**Overview**

The bot listens for messages on Telegram and responds using a pre-trained language model. It supports natural language interaction, making it ideal for creative writing, brainstorming, or just casual conversation.

**Features**

. Integrates with Telegram using an async bot framework

. Uses a lightweight language model (TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat) for text generation

. Generates creative, coherent, and context-aware responses

. Configurable generation settings like temperature and top-k sampling

**How It Works**

When a user sends a message to the bot on Telegram, it passes the message to a language model pipeline. The model generates a thoughtful reply, which is then sent back to the user through the chat.
